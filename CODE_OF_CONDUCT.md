# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

At GeoThai, we strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participation in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Age
- Body size
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Gender identity and expression
- Level of experience
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race
- Religion
- Sexual identity and orientation

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and inclusive environment for all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without their explicit permission.

## Enforcement

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any abusive behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the participant or expulsion from the community.

## Addressing Grievances

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a project maintainer as soon as possible. All complaints will be reviewed and addressed promptly.

## Scope
